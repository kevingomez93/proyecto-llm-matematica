To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of getting a 4 and a 3 when rolling two fair dice.

The probability of getting a 4 on the first die is 1/6, and the probability of getting a 3 on the second die is also 1/6.

To find the probability of getting a total of 7, we need to multiply the probabilities of each possible combination:

(1/6) Ã— (1/6) = 1/36

So, the probability of rolling two dice and getting a total of 7 is 1/36.
